1Ô∏è‚É£ LFSR in Python <br />
A simple 4-bit LFSR implementation using XOR feedback to generate a pseudo-random sequence. <br />
<br />
2Ô∏è‚É£ LFSR-based PRNG in Verilog <br />
A hardware compatible implementation of an LFSR-based pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) using Verilog for FPGA based applications.<br />
<br />
3Ô∏è‚É£ LFSR-based Stream Cipher <br />
An LFSR-based encryption system where LFSR output acts as a keystream for XOR-based encryption. <br />
Concept <br />
‚û§ LFSR generates a pseudo-random keystream. <br />
‚û§ XOR operation is used for stream cipher encryption/decryption. <br />
‚û§ Only sender and receiver need to know the LFSR parameters. <br />
<br />
üìå Applications <br />
‚û§ Random Number Generation (RNG) <br />
‚û§ Stream Ciphers & Encryption <br />
‚û§ Cryptographic Key Expansion <br />
‚û§ FPGA-based Secure Communication <br />
‚û§ Error Detection in Data Transmission <br />
